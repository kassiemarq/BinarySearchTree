# BinSearchTree 
Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

This C++ implementation takes uppercase characters only. 

User is first prompted with a menu that has the following options:
-------------------- MENU ----------------------
1. Insert node(s)
2. Traverse Preorder
3. Search BST
4. Delete node
5. Leaf Count
6. Sibling of a node
7. Quit

After user makes the selection, program continues to prompt user with menu until user decides to quit as indicated with option 7.
